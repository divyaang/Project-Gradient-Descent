# Project-Gradient-Descent

The basic work done in this project include:

1. Coded the Gradient Descent algorithm for N features and have come with predictions.
2. Tried and test various combinations of learning rates and number of iterations.
3. Used Feature Scaling better results.

The above mentioned tasks have been implemented for two Datasets which are:

A. Boston dataset which is available in sklearn.
B. Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset which contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.

This project was done as a part of Data Science and Machine Learning course offered by Coding Ninjas.
